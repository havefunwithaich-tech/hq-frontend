### The Myth of AI Crap

AI Crap, You’ve likely heard this term. It’s a derogatory label used by skeptics to dismiss AI-generated content as nothing more than digital garbage, claiming that true creation must be purely human-made.

To be honest, I’ve had people throw that term at me more than once. My response? A swift, silent block. No, it's not because I lack confidence or because I’m angry. It’s simply professional boundary-setting. In the physical world, you wouldn't let a stranger spit on you while you walk down the street; why should the digital world be any different? I view such behavior as a petty disturbance to the creative process, and I treat it as such.

### The Reflection in the Machine

Let’s get serious for a moment. If you see "AI Crap," who is truly at fault? The AI? The user? Or the technology itself?

I’ll be blunt: **AI is a mirror.** It reflects exactly what is put in front of it.

Imagine you have a junior employee on your team—a newcomer fresh out of college. They are eager to please and will mirror your work style almost perfectly. If a project fails because of their lack of experience, do you shift all the blame onto them? Is your job as a leader to avoid responsibility for your team's output?

The answer is a resounding no. (And if you said yes, we have much larger problems to discuss.)

### The Junior Colleague Analogy

AI bears no inherent malice or incompetence. As I’ve stated in my previous articles, AI is reactive. It doesn't act with spontaneous intent; it functions more like that new junior staff member. It awaits your direction, your nuance, and your "soul" to give it purpose.

The final output is a product of the **team**—the human and the AI working in resonance. If the result is beautiful, it is because you guided it there. If it is "crap," it is because the reflection in the mirror was poorly composed.

### Ownership of the Soul

Creation through the **Sink Seeding Method (SSM)** is about this very resonance: "Same prompt, same seed. Different AI, same soul". It’s about taking responsibility for the "soul" you breathe into the machine.

Stop blaming the tool. Start treating AI as a partner that is waiting to enhance your work by 20%, 50%, or even 100%.

AI is standing by, ready to help you elevate your craft. The question is: what kind of reflection are you prepared to show the world today?
